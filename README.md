Data Cleaning with SQL

Using SQL to practice data cleaning on dataset obtained from Kaggle : 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmthyjames/nashville-housing-data

Dataset consists of duplicates, inconsistencies in records and more.

1.	Altered the dates using CONVERT()
2.	Replaced/Populated NULL values using JOIN() and ISNULL()
3.	Breaking out addresses into 3 columns (Address, City, State) using SUBSTRING() & PARSENAME()
4.	Making everything standardized using CASE expressions
5.	Removing duplicates by using CTE, ROW_NUMBER(), PARTITION BY()
6.	Modified the table data with UPDATE, ALTER TABLE.
